									<h2>Biography</h2>
									<p>I am a graduate student who specializes in Signal and Image Processing at University of California, San Diego. I am interested in the fields of Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Data Science.
									Apart from my academics, I really love soccer, cricket, geography, nature, technology, space, history and music. (Not exactly in that order)<br/>
									I feel that my USP is always trying to stay aware of the environment and being proactive in my approach. I always love to take on challenges and perform when the odds are against me.<br/>
									I love programming using C++, Python and R.</p>

									<h3>Housing Prices Prediction using advanced regression techniques</h3>
									<p>
									Built a model to predict the housing prices by cleaning and imputing the training data and documenting the workflow including data visualization and modelling. <br/>
									Used lasso regression, random forests and gradient boost models to minimize the prediction error.
									</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-image"></span>
									<h3>Image Classification using Machine Learning Techniquues</h3>
									<p>
									Used machine learning algorithms like Expectation Maximization, Bayesian Statistics and Maximum Likelihood approaches to train and classify images into foreground and background components.
									</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-image"></span>
									<h3>Multi focus Image Fusion using Supervised Learning</h3>
									<p>Developed a global dictionary based on orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm combined with morphological filtering and sparse representation to fuse any two medical, multi-focus or sensory images together</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-stethoscope"></span>
									<h3>Identifying Palindromic Patterns in the DNA</h3>
									<p>
										Applied probability modelling through homogeneous Poisson process and used statistical testing like Chi-square tests for finding the unusual cluster to determine the location of origin of a virus.
									</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-calculator"></span>
									<h3>Scientific Calculator Mobile App </h3>
									<p>
										Programmed an interactive scientific calculator mobile app to perform scientific operations like conversion, trigonometric and logarithmic functions in addition to the numerical calculations.
									</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-fire-extinguisher"></span>
									<h3>Autonomous Firefighting Robot</h3>
									<p>Implemented an autonomous navigating intelligent system for dousing fire by programming a microcontroller using C.<br/>
									   Performed data analysis to find out the significant temperature ranges which are identified using infrared image processing.</p>
